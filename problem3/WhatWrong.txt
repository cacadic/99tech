What’s wrong and why

1) Weak/incorrect typing
- getPriority(blockchain: any) uses any.
- WalletBalance lacks a blockchain field but the code reads balance.blockchain.
- prices is used as a dictionary but untyped.
- Props extends BoxProps is declared but children is unused.

2) Buggy filter/sort logic
- lhsPriority is referenced but never defined.
- Filter returns true only when amount <= 0 and priority > -99 → keeps empty balances and drops real ones.
- Comparator doesn’t return 0 for equal priority.
- sort runs inside useMemo but the comparator is asymmetrical and may return undefined.

3) Misuse of hooks / unnecessary deps
- useMemo depends on prices though it’s not used, causing needless re-renders.
- getPriority is recreated every render; better as a module-level constant map.

4) Data shape mismatches
- formattedBalances produces formatted, but rows maps over sortedBalances and then reads balance.formatted, which doesn’t exist there.

5) Rendering inefficiencies / anti-patterns
- key={index} leads to unstable reconciliation; use a stable, domain key.
- toFixed() without digits forces integer rounding and returns a string; precision likely wrong for money.
- Spreads ...rest onto a div that may receive non-DOM props from BoxProps.

6) Other correctness/robustness issues
- Potential prices[balance.currency] undefined → NaN usdValue.
- classes.row is referenced but not defined in the snippet.
